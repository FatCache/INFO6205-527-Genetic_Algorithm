## Applying Genetic Algorithm to the Traveling Salesman Problem

The Travelling Salesman Problem (often called [TSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)) is a classic algorithmic problem in the field of computer science and operations research. It is focused on optimization. There are numerous methodology developed over the decades to find the ideal solution in the shortest span of time & space. One of the techniques is to apply [Genetic Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) to the problem. 

In this academic project, an algorithm is developed (written in Java), to carry out an experimental approach to find an *ideal* solution to a problem where our solution space spans across up to **2.432902e+18 (20!) possible elements**.
